DYSIGNS — Setup & Custom Domain Guide
======================================

1. LOCAL DEVELOPMENT
--------------------
Prerequisites: Node.js v20+ (LTS), npm or pnpm

  git clone <your-repo-url> dysigns
  cd dysigns
  npm install            # or: pnpm install
  npm run dev            # starts dev server at http://localhost:5173

Production build:
  npm run build          # output: dist/

Preview production build locally:
  npx vite preview       # serves dist/ at http://localhost:4173


2. DEPLOY OPTION A — VERCEL
----------------------------
Step 1: Push repo to GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket.

Step 2: Go to https://vercel.com/new
        Click "Import" and select your repository.

Step 3: Verify build settings (Vercel auto-detects Vite):
        - Build command:    npm run build
        - Output directory: dist
        - Install command:  npm install

Step 4: Add SPA rewrite. Create vercel.json in the repo root:

        {
          "rewrites": [{ "source": "/(.*)", "destination": "/index.html" }]
        }

Step 5: Click "Deploy". Vercel assigns a URL like your-project.vercel.app.

Step 6: Every push to the production branch auto-deploys.


3. DEPLOY OPTION B — NETLIFY
------------------------------
Step 1: Push repo to GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket.

Step 2: Go to https://app.netlify.com
        Click "Add new site" > "Import an existing project".
        Select your repository.

Step 3: Set build settings:
        - Build command:      npm run build
        - Publish directory:  dist

Step 4: Add SPA redirect. Create public/_redirects with this content:

        /*    /index.html   200

Step 5: Click "Deploy site". Netlify assigns a URL like your-site.netlify.app.

Step 6: Every push auto-deploys.


4. CONNECT A CUSTOM DOMAIN
----------------------------

--- Vercel ---

Step 1: In the Vercel dashboard, go to your project > Settings > Domains.

Step 2: Add your root domain:
        example.com

Step 3: Add www subdomain:
        www.example.com

Step 4: At your domain registrar (GoDaddy, Namecheap, Cloudflare, etc.),
        create the following DNS records:

        TYPE    HOST    VALUE                         TTL
        ----    ----    -----                         ---
        A       @       76.76.21.21                   3600
        CNAME   www     cname.vercel-dns.com          3600

        Note: If your registrar supports ALIAS or ANAME records for the
        apex domain, use ALIAS pointing to cname.vercel-dns.com instead
        of the A record.

Step 5: In Vercel, set your preferred primary domain (root or www).
        The other will redirect automatically.

Step 6: SSL is provisioned automatically once DNS resolves. No action needed.
        HTTPS is enforced by default.


--- Netlify ---

Step 1: In the Netlify dashboard, go to Domain management > Add custom domain.

Step 2: Add your root domain:
        example.com

Step 3: Netlify prompts to also add www.example.com. Confirm.

Step 4: At your domain registrar, create the following DNS records:

        TYPE    HOST    VALUE                              TTL
        ----    ----    -----                              ---
        A       @       75.2.60.5                          3600
        CNAME   www     your-site-name.netlify.app         3600

        Note: If your registrar supports ALIAS, ANAME, or CNAME
        flattening (Cloudflare, DNSimple), point the apex to
        your-site-name.netlify.app instead of using the A record.

Step 5: In Netlify, set your primary domain (root or www).
        The other will redirect automatically.

Step 6: Go to Domain management > HTTPS.
        Click "Verify DNS configuration".
        Click "Provision certificate" (uses Let's Encrypt).
        Enable "Force HTTPS" in the same section.


5. VERIFICATION CHECKLIST
--------------------------

DNS propagation (may take 5 minutes to 48 hours):

  Check A record:
    dig example.com +short
    Expected: 76.76.21.21 (Vercel) or 75.2.60.5 (Netlify)

  Check CNAME record:
    dig www.example.com +short
    Expected: cname.vercel-dns.com or your-site-name.netlify.app

  Online checker:
    https://dnschecker.org — enter your domain, verify global propagation.

SSL verification:

  1. Open https://example.com in a browser.
  2. Check for the padlock icon in the address bar.
  3. Click the padlock to verify the certificate issuer:
     - Vercel: issued by "Vercel" or "Let's Encrypt"
     - Netlify: issued by "Let's Encrypt"

Both domains work:

  1. Visit https://example.com — should load the site.
  2. Visit https://www.example.com — should redirect to primary or load directly.

SPA routing works:

  1. Navigate directly to https://example.com/work
  2. The page should render correctly, not show a 404.
  3. Navigate directly to https://example.com/about — same result.

All done. Your DYSIGNS site is live.
